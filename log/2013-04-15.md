Morning
-------

 - Have submitted PR for expand references
 - Have updated travel3.dantleech.com and commented code review for blog bundle
 - 11:52 - Made post display the stats formatted with the TimeDistanceBundle
   - Changed signature of TDBs `format_distance` filter. Not sure about this, should probably change the API one day.
   - Updated TDB on packagist
 - 11:57 - Do the same as previous in list.
   - Split journey table into separate partial, overridden blog post list template
 - 12:06 - Verify if media stuff works for posts.
   - It would be better if the fixtures for posts did not change their node names and dates each time.
   - Made blog post dates and titles static.
 - NOTE: Very messy in travel bundle. Application code is spread out over 3 bundles: app/Resources, src/Sandbox and src/DTL/TravelBundle
 - Seems to be some problem with the Thumbnail URLs in SonataMediaBundle for PHPCR
     - pfft... 768mb of ram isnt enough for running firefox AND jackrabbit. Switching  back to Doctrine DBAL
 - 13:19 - PHPCR-ODM: Investigate DateTime problem
   - Submitted PR for jackalope-doctrine-dbal
   - 14:05 - Have no idea how the `phpcr-api-tests` work, submitted PR for help.
 - SONATA-MEDIA: format "small" is not registered, only "default_small". Why?
   - 14:30 - Because I wasnt setting the "context" on import whenmanually creating the medias. Why doesnt Sonata Media throw an Exception in such case?
   - 15:09 - Success! View posts page is working. Travel site is almost ready to be used...
 - 19:00 - Updating and deploying live site.
   - Discovered problem with PHPCR-ODM - only one media is being associated with a NEW ChronoData during the import. Subsequent runs add all the medias. Some problem with the UnitOfWork which is going to be a real PITA to find.
