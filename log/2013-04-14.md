 - BLOG-BUNDLE: Theming options for backend, default edit template
    - 12:37 - Spent long time making custom template for editing blog posts.
    - 12:44 - Should really stop fiddling with the template and make the date widget work better.
    - 13:02 - Found out that the form components DateTimeToString transformer accepts all formats accepted by `mktime`. Kinda expected, but nice.
 - 14:32 - Fixed up blog PR and merged to master, branching old as 0.1. Also created issues and closed old ones.
 
 - 17:19 - Fix bug in blog bundle master for tags -- need functional tests, DONE.
 - 17:27 - Preview links - list all routes on a blog post on edit pag.e
 - 17:59 - More tags problems, .. hmm .. functional tests.
 - 18:15 - TASK: Chronology Bundle -- bundle to associate documents with dates using references.
   - HOWTO: Create a bundle, copy RoutingAutoBundle:
     - perl -i.bak -pe 's/RoutingAuto/Chronology/g' `find ./ -name "*.php"`
     - find ./ -name "*.bak" | xargs rm
     - 19:09 - Hmm.. I wonder if this wouldnt be easily accomplishable in a tagging bundle. It is just a taxonomy of dates afterall. If the TaxonomyBundle had an AutoTaxomizer service then that would solve the problem.
   - Just do this quick n dirty in TravelBundle
 - 20:08 - Dirty hack complete, trying to display medias on blog post.
 - 20:34 - Have added "theoretical" gallery on blog post page, but need to test. Trying to add "force-date" option to import images.
 - 00:39 - done - PHPCR-ODM: Show referring documents in dumps - confirms the chronolizer is working properly.
