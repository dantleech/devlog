Morning
-------

- Added support to `doctrine:phpcr:purge` to only purge children nodes.
  And impoved messags
- Was getting error when accessing the list of medias on SonataMedia about ID
  "/cms/blah/blah.jpg" not matching regex "[^/].*?". Need to add requirement
  ".+" to allow "/" char in `routing.yml`. But this is something that should be
  handled natively in SonataMediaBundle.
- Trying to import images from filesystem to SonataMediaBundle. Just
  needed to set binary content with `setBinaryContent('/path/to/file.jpg')` for
  the file to be uploaded, metadata read and thumbnail created.

Afternoon
---------

 - 17:04 - Implementing GPS coordinates and camera metadata into custom Media doc
 - Looking into what the three fractions in the exif long/latitude geolocation
   data mean:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5449282/reading-geotag-data-from-image-in-php
 - 17:46 - GPS Coordinates imported, including Altitude
 - Setting timestamp on import
 - Should there be an Interface library in CMF? e.g. 
   - GeotaggedInterface 
   - TimestampableInterface
   - DistanceInterface
   - DurationInterface
 - 18:07 - DONE: Media to implement some sort of GPSInterface
 - TASK: Extend BlogBundle Post to implement traveling stats
   - Duration (in seconds), Distance (in meters), Max Speed (in kph)
   - Integrate my DistanceTimeBundle
   - Implement/extend admin class
 - (regression) fixed bug with timestamp import, was getting FILE timestamp and not EXIF timestamp.
 - 18:47 - Why is the DI configuration so fucking difficult to use? All I want is a node with children.
   - Solution: (arrayNode)->addDefaultsIfNotSet()
   - 19:27 - DocumentClass.phpcr.xml should be DocumentClass.phpcr-odm.xml
     - @Long would be better as @Integer no?

````
    $p->setDistance($dist = rand(33, 160) * 1000);
    $p->setDuration((($dist / 1000) / rand(14, 30) * 3600));
    $p->setMaxSpeed(rand(33, 60));

 - 19:50 - TIP: Allow ``blog: ~`` to use deafult value - (scalarNode)->treatNullLike($deafult)
 - 20:00 - Integrating time/distance stuff into PostAdmin
   - Form types? distance-time-bundle?
 - 22:54 - Have been updating dtl/time-distance-bundle, adding form types,
   sorting out namespaces, composer.etc
 - 23:41 - Puzzled as to why distance value is not being submitted to transformer in form
 - 00:19 - DONE: Extend BlogBundle Post to implement Traveling stats
   - Updated dtl-time-distance-bundle into working state with form types.
