- Added support to `doctrine:phpcr:purge` to only purge children nodes.
  And impoved messags
- Was getting error when accessing the list of medias on SonataMedia about ID
  "/cms/blah/blah.jpg" not matching regex "[^/].*?". Need to add requirement
  ".+" to allow "/" char in `routing.yml`. But this is something that should be
  handled natively in SonataMediaBundle.
- Trying to import images from filesystem to SonataMediaBundle. Just
  needed to set binary content with `setBinaryContent('/path/to/file.jpg')` for
  the file to be uploaded, metadata read and thumbnail created.
