- TASK: Get the tree browser working in travel blog
  - Howto get tree browser working:
    - Add fos_routing route:     resource: @FOSJsRoutingBundle/Resources/config/routing/routing.xml
    - Refister FOSjsRoutingBundleA

````
Error: The route "_symfony_cmf_tree_phpcr_odm_tree_children" does not exist.
Source File: http://travel.localhost/bundles/fosjsrouting/js/router.js
Line: 9
````
   - Add:

````
symfony_cmf_tree:
    resource: .
    type: 'symfony_cmf_tree'
````

   - But now no tree .. lets read the documentation..

````
sonata_doctrine_phpcr_admin:
    document_tree:
        Doctrine\ODM\PHPCR\Document\Generic:
            valid_children:
                - all
````

 - 11:14 - Tree browser FORM TYPE works now.
 - When accessing content page: You have requested a non-existent service "symfony_cmf_menu.admin".
500 Internal Server Error - ServiceNotFoundException 

 - Had to change menu bundles "use_sonata_admin" from "false" to "true"
 - 11:33 - Have added security to travel-blog
 - 11:51 - Installing KNPMarkDown bundle, need to override templates to make them markdown

 - 12:22 - First AUTO-ROUTING bug! Changing name of intermediate route crashes.

 - Bug seems infact with PHPCR-ODM. Removing validation in jackalope / Node.php reorderBeforeArray() works. Seems Node.php node names are not updated before reorder.
 - 14:10 - Trying to reproduce PHPCR-ODM bug in test. Waiting for composer ...
